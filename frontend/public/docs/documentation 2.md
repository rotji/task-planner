Perfect — we’ll structure the **AI Task Planner** so it evolves in **3 stages: Basic → Medium → Complex**, and each stage aligns with hackathon requirements and prize opportunities.

# ✅ ✅ DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP (3 STAGES)

## ✅ 1️⃣ BASIC STAGE (MVP) — Submit Fast ✅

🎯 Goal: Meet **minimum hackathon submission requirements**
✔ Fits **Track 2 – Agent Applications**
✔ Can be finished & deployed in <11 days
✔ Ready for video + GitHub + demo

### ✅ Features:

* Simple web interface (React/Vite or Next.js)
* One input field: “Enter your goal”
* The ADK-TS agent generates task steps
* Basic Express/Node+TS backend
* JSON response shown on frontend
* Deploy frontend + backend (Netlify/Vercel/Railway)

### ✅ Earns eligibility for:

✅ Track 2 (Agent Applications)
✅ Bonus: “Most Practical Real-World Use Case” (maybe)

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ MEDIUM STAGE (Upgrade after MVP)

🎯 Goal: Qualify for **other bonus tracks** and impress judges

### ✅ Upgrade Features:

Add one or more of the following:

#### ✅ Option A: Save task plans

* Use MongoDB, Firebase, or JSON storage
* User can view past plans

#### ✅ Option B: Add a Bot Integration

* Telegram bot or Discord bot
* Same agent logic, extra entry point
* Eligible for “Best Bot Integration”

#### ✅ Option C: Multi-Agent or Collaboration Feature

* Separate “Planner Agent” and “Scheduler Agent”
* Eligible for “Best Collaboration/Team Agent”

✅ At this level, you now qualify for:

* “Best Technical Implementation”
* “Best Collaboration/Team Agent”
* “Best Bot Integration”

## ✅ 3️⃣ COMPLEX STAGE (Final Expansion / Track Upgrade)

🎯 Goal: Compete for more prize tracks (MCP + Web3)

Choose **1 of these** paths depending on direction:

### ✅ Path 1: MCP Integration (Track 1 eligibility)

* Create MCP server that connects to:

  * Notion
  * Google Calendar
  * Jira
  * Todoist
* AI can create/sync tasks automatically

🎯 Earns eligibility for:
✅ Track 1 – MCP Expansion
✅ Bonus: Best Improvement to ADK-TS

---

### ✅ Path 2: Web3 Integration (Track 3 eligibility)

* AI-generated plans stored on-chain OR
* DAO task planning agent OR
* Task-based token incentives

Example:

* Smart contract (via Solidity + ethers.js)
* Store user goals/tasks on a testnet (Polygon, Sepolia, etc.)
* Agent helps create/govern tasks via Web3

🎯 Earns eligibility for:
✅ Track 3 – Web3 Use Case
✅ Bonus: Best Technical Implementation

# ✅ ✅ SUMMARY TABLE

| Stage   | Features Included                | Tracks Eligible | Bonus Ready   |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Basic   | AI agent + Web UI + Deploy       | Track 2         | Maybe 1 bonus |
| Medium  | Save plans OR bot OR multi-agent | Track 2         | 2–3 bonuses   |
| Complex | MCP or Web3 integration          | Track 1 or 3    | 3–4 bonuses   |

# ✅ ✅ Your Next Confirmation:

To move forward, we need to finalize the **Basic Stage tech stack**.

Answer just this now:

👉 For the frontend, should we start with:
**Vite + React** ✅ (fast, lightweight)
or
**Next.js** ✅ (SEO, routing, Vercel-native)

Reply: **Vite** or **Next.js**
(Then I’ll create the file structure for the Basic stage immediately.)
